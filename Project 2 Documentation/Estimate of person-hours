For project 2, our group felt that around 10 hours a person would be needed to complete the project. We came to this result using the lines of coding method by estimating how
much code would be needed to implement the AI portion of the project along with adding our own custom addion. Another factor that went into estimating the lines of code was
using a new language for every member, we believed that more lines of code will be needed as we do not have an in depth understanding of rust and therefore we would spread
out the code more than it would necessarily need.
